# AMSC808N

This repository stores all the MATLAB code developed by Jiaqi Leng for projects/homeworks of AMSC808N. 

- For project 1, go to the folder 'Project1'. Some codes provided by Maria are not given here, e.g., **Project1main.m**. I did not change these public codes, but just use some blocks to build my own **project1_driver.m**, which contains the driver code for all 4 problems. 
- For problem 3 in homework 3, go to the folder 'Homework 3'. I choose Problem 1 in the LLF paper. Run **driver.m** and the plot (accuracy of the computed result) will be available.
